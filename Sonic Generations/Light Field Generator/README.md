1. Create a folder called "stage", and paste the resources and terrain folders from your stage in there (unpack with GLvl 0.9, and get the folders from cache)
2. Convert DDS textures in terrain to PNG (no need to delete the originals)
3. Run "lightfield.exe"
4. Copy "light-field.lft" in the same folder as the executable to the .ar.00 file in Packed (where Stage.pfd is) and play the game.

To tone down the light field strength, decrease "SampleBlendDistance" in the lightfield.ini file.
