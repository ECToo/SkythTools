You can modify transformation settings in "TransformGensStage.cfg" file.  
To mirror stages, you need to make the X scale negative.

Using the program:
1. Drag 'n drop the #Stage.ar.00 file (eg. "#ghz200.ar.00") to transform set data, splines and collision.
	- Sometimes, _brk.phy.hkx files can cause crashes. In that case, simply remove these files from the AR archives.
2. Drag 'n drop the Packed folder (eg. "Packed/ghz200") that contains resource ARs and Stage.pfd to transform terrain.
